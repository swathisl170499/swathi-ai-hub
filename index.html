        <h1>👋 Hi, I’m <span>Lakshmi Swathi Sreedhar</span></h1>
        <h2>Generative AI Systems | RAG | Agentic Intelligence</h2>
        <p class="summary">
          I’m an AI Engineer driven by a passion for building intelligent, customer-facing systems that blend reasoning, data, and design into real-world impact. As a forward-deployed engineer, I thrive at the intersection of technology and product, turning complex ideas into intuitive, production-ready AI solutions that scale. My expertise spans Generative AI, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Agentic Intelligence, where I design copilots, Text2SQL frameworks, and adaptive agents that make data truly conversational. I love creating AI that feels human-centered and outcome-driven—systems that not only solve problems but redefine how teams think and operate. Looking ahead, I’m focused on evolving toward AI product architecture and strategy, shaping frameworks that combine innovation, usability, and measurable enterprise value.
