  <section id="about">
  <h2>ðŸ§¬ About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Iâ€™m driven by a product mindset and a passion for making AI not just powerful, but genuinely useful, intuitive, and scalable. I thrive at the crossroads of machine learning, product design, and creative problem-solvingâ€”building intelligent systems that help people think, work, and create better every day.
  </p>
  <p>
    Recently, my work has centered on crafting LLM-powered solutions, Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipelines, and prompt engineering techniques that transform cutting-edge AI into real-world impact. My toolkit includes Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, SQL, and cloud platforms like Azure and GCP â€” but what truly excites me is shaping these technologies into thoughtful user experiences that solve complex business challenges.
  </p>
  <p>
    I hold a Masterâ€™s degree in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Michiganâ€“Dearborn, and I completed MITâ€™s No-Code AI and Machine Learning program â€” blending deep technical expertise with practical systems thinking.
  </p>
  <p>
    ðŸ‘‰ Iâ€™m growing into roles that blend AI engineering, ML development, solution architecture, and technical product strategy. Iâ€™m passionate about end-to-end system design where innovation, usability, and performance come together seamlessly.
  </p>
  <p>
    When Iâ€™m not building AI, Iâ€™m mentoring, exploring open-source projects, and diving into research that pushes AI toward more human-centered applications.
  </p>
  <p>
    If youâ€™re working on something innovative or just love discussing where AI is headed, letâ€™s connect!
